#WHY Gulp not Grunt or Webpack?
1. A fronÂ­tend workÂ­flow automaÂ­tion tool Grunt is someÂ­what more verÂ­bose to conÂ­figÂ­ure. Itâ€™s also in genÂ­erÂ­al slowÂ­er than Gulp for buildÂ­ing things, due to its file-oriÂ­entÂ­ed approach.
2. For webÂ­pack to be used effecÂ­tiveÂ­ly, it realÂ­ly needs to be embraced whole-hog and used not just as a modÂ­ule bundler, but as a modÂ­ule loader as well.
